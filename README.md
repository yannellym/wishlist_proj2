## Notes

I encountered many problems while trying to update the recyclerView. I knew how to read hardcoded text, but did not know how to get the user's input. 
I ended up realizing that I had to include more textView Fields. I also struggled with implementing a new theme as this is something very new to me. 
Overall, I learned about themes, and longhold. I also learned how to implement RecyclerView.
